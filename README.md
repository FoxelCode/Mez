# Mez
A maze generator and crawler in the style of the legendary Windows 95/98 maze screensaver.

Generates a maze and starts crawling through it, generating a new one when it finds the end of the current maze.
Builds can be found at https://foxelbox.itch.io/mez along with the WebGL version.

Tested with WebGL HTML5, Windows Standalone and Windows Screensaver (.scr).
Should probably export to other platforms as well (Linux, macOS), but I haven't tested this.
