A maze generator and crawler in the style of the legendary Windows 95/98 maze screensaver.

A lil' screensaver thing that generates a maze and starts crawling through it, generating a new one when it finds the end of the current maze.
Tested with WebGL HTML5, Windows Standalone and Windows Screensaver (.scr).
Should probably export to other platforms as well (Linux, macOS), but I haven't tested this.
